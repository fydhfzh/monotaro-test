# monotaro-test

## General Guide
To run this app, you need to use Python (I'm using Python 3.12.0) and pip along with venv to isolate the environment during the development. I provide the requirements.txt file for all the package needed for running this application.

Create virtual environment first using venv before you install the related packages inside requirements.txt file
```
python -m venv env
```
